Course: CSE 445 / 598
Assignment: 5 – Service-Oriented Web Application
Instructor: ASU


## Overview
Overview

This project is my Assignment 5 implementation, demonstrating concepts from the course using an ASP.NET Web Forms application with service components and a DLL library.

The application is a simple Utility Web Application containing:

A Default landing page

A custom hashing DLL

A Weather Lookup Web Service (ASMX)

A Service Directory table

A Global.asax event handler

TryIt interfaces for testing each component

This assignment focuses on component creation, service development, and integration, not authentication or data storage (that comes in Assignment 6).
